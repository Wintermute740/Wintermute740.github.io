<p>We finally made it to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">Revolutions</a>,
 that unsatistfying end to the original Matrix trilogy. I no longer feel like
 <a href="the-matrix-reloaded.html">Reloaded</a> ruined it, and it's not a <b>bad</b>
 movie. It just wasn't great. I'm glad I finally rewatched it.</p>

<p>Overall, the entire trilogy holds up fairly well. The original was mind-blowing
 when it came out and is still a great film. The other two are simultaniously
 better and worse than I remembered them. The second one was too long and the ending
 just wasn't very satisfying, which is probably why they eventually made the new one,
 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10838180/">The Matrix: Cash Grab</a>, errr... 
 <b>Resurrections</b>. I'll be wrapping up with that next, even though it took me
 several attempts to make it through it the first time.</p>

<p>The rewatch continues with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The 
 Animatrix</a>. It's harder to judge this one, as it's the only animated one in the
 series, and is also a bunch of different shorts taking place at vaious different
 times in the chonology. This is why I am doing these in release order instead of
 chronologically.</p>

<p>Some of the shorts are prequels, some take place between the movies, and some
 have no specific timeframe and could take place at any time before, during, or
 after the original trilogy. They are considered canon, though, so I included them
 in the rewatch.</p>

<p>I  amd not a huge anime fan, but I remember enjoying these when they came out,
 and I still enjoyed them on this rewatch. The styles they're done in varies, and
 I quite enjoyed the different ways they were animated. The range from more traditional
 anime to near-realistic, almost uncanny valley, type of animation. And the stories
 really flesh out the universe a bit, which gives the entire series much more depth.</p>

<p>I decided to not skip anything in my rewatch of <a href="/the-matrix.html">The
 Matrix</a>, and am watching them in release order, so that meants I did wind up
 watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">Reloaded</a> last night.</p>

<p>I think this is the first time I've rewatched it since it came out. As previously
 mentioned, I had originally thought that the series was stronger without it, and
 that it someone ruined <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">Revolutions</a>.
 While still not my favorite movie, I didn't find it nearly as bad as I did way
 back when I originally watched it. There are a few scenes which probably should
 have never made it past the cutting room, but overall it was better than I remembered.</p>

<p>Because I am going in release order, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The
 Animatrix</a> is next.</p>

<p>Continuing on my binge of older movies, I just finished the first of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>
 trilogy, and I am suprised at how well it holds up.</p>

<p>I remember when this one first came out. My wife an I watched a *lot* of movies
 back then. We had gone to a packed cinema on a Friday or Saturday evening and took
 her brother and parents with us. The showing was nearly sold out, and we wound up
 with crappy seats (way too close and way too off from the center of the screen) for
 a movie none of us had actually heard of. And then the lights went down and the
 movie started, and all the complaining about being too crowded and crappy seats
 suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the original held up extremely well. I did not like the second
 film in the series, and always felt like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">
 Revolutions</a> would have been much better if Reloaded had never happened, so I don't know
 whether to skip <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">Reloaded</a> and go
 straight to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The Animatrix</a> or not.</p>

<p>This one is a bit newer than <a href="/the-blues-brothers.html">The Blues Brothers</a>,
 and I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler, but <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109068/">Airheads</a>
 was another great music comedy that I just finished a rewatch of. Definitely going in my rotation for
 fairly regular rewatch.</p>

<p>Many times, when I watch a movie that I haven't seen in a long time, it triggers
 a flood of memories. Not so with this one, but I enjoyed every minute of the extended
 cut of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080455/">The Blues Brothers</a>. This
 is such an amazing movie, even 45-ish years after I first saw it, that I didn't even
 notice that is was 2 1/2 hours.</p>

<p>John Belushi was such an amazing actor who left us way too soon, but this movie is
 filled with amazing talent, from the comedic actors to the amazing musicians who lend
 their talent to the movie. There are also a ton of great cameos. Some of them are
 pretty obvious, but some of them not so much. ;) I won't spoil them for you if you
 have never noticed some of the actors and musicians (and others) who show up in a
 scene here or there, but even many of the &quot;extras&quot; were, or later became,
 famous in their own right. ;)</p>

<p>If it's been awhile since you've seen it, or especially if you've never seen it
 before, you owe it to yourself to watch it as soon as you have the time.</p>

 <a href="https://ominouswoosh.neocities.org/">Twin Peaks</a>, and I will add sites as I go. Some of the links will be to people I know, or close to someone I know, and some
 will just be stuff I've stumbled across, probably via a <a href="http://webring.dinhe.net/random">Random</a> <a href="http://wiby.me/surprise/">button</a> for one of the

<p><img src="images/series10.jpg" width="25%" align="left"/>I wrote this on FB the other day,
 but thought I should share it here as well:<br />
 <br />
It's funny how I used to have a near-photographic memory, but now I barely remember my childhood,
 and even my teen years, at all, other than as vague shadows. But sometimes, something comes 
 alongs and opens the floodgates. Usually music. :) And I was just watching Led Zeppelin's 
 <i>The Song Remains the Same</i> for the first time since I was 16, and I was suddenly transported
 to a house on Clayton Drive in Lancaster. I was friends with two brothers, and their house was 
 practically a second home for the lot of us who hung out together. We watched that movie so many 
 times... That, and <i>Headbanger's Ball</i> on MTV, and a bunch of of AC/DC concerts on VHS. Brian 
 was the first of us to own a guitar... A Bently Series 10, if I remember correctly... I'm 99% 
 certain one identical to the one on this post... And I "sang" while he played. Of course, being 
 metal, and having to project my voice over his amp, it was more screaming than singing, but still...
 lol... Even when the rest of our friends were off doing other things, I was either working out with 
 Greg or jamming with Brian.<br />
<br />
They were from Cincinnati, and a bit after I moved to Georgia in high school, they moved away from 
 Lancaster. I believe back to Cincinnati. But after that, I lost contact with those two. Two of the 
 other guys in the band I jammed with up until the pandemic were part of that group of friends, and
 they had lost contact as well. The entire group of us were great friends, but Brian was my best 
 friend for a couple of years, up until I moved. I've tried to find the two of them online, but I 
 honestly doubt either ever developed much of an online presence...
