<p>This is the second season that I've had an RV in a seasonal spot, and I am quickly coming to realize how much more I enjoy it than having the house. So I am seriously considering whether or not to move into it completely next year when the lease for my house it up. The six months I can stay in the RV costs just over two months of rent at the house (possibly the same, if my rent goes up again), plus the electric bill is cheaper, there is no water or sanitation bill, my internet is half the cost, etc, so I would easily save over $2000/month for the sixe months I were there. I'm WFH, so there's no concern about costs of communiting. I won't have any yard work. There are so many advantages, and I stay at the RV for up to 2 weeks at a time as it is, only returning to the house for laundry (the campground has onsite facilities, though) and lawn care.</p>
<p>I have several smaller concerns, the biggest one is finding a street address to provide to the FCC for my amateur radio license. They will only accept a street address, and if you don't respond to a mailing they can revoke your license. The next biggest is finding a place to move into at the end of the season. I could save the money I'm paying in rent and add solar to the RV, moving it from spot to spot every couple of weeks on federal land over the winter months. Hauling in water and finding a dump station that operates in the winter could be fun, though. The RV does have a thermal package, so heating wouldn't be a major concern. It doesn't get cold enough in Ohio for the propane case to change to liquid, so that shouldn't be a concern either, as long as I keep my tanks clear of snow and ice.</p>
<p>I think the ultimate goal would be to find some land to buy in an RV-friendly area, install a well and sceptic system on the land, and move the RV, once it is solar-equiped, there and live out of it full-time. I could always build shed and solar equip them as well for additional living space, such as a ham shack, laundry room, workshop, etc.</p>
<p>Anyhow, anyone out there still reading my blog? And do they have any suggestions? wintermute@ my domain will get them to me ;)</p>
