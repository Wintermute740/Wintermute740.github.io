<p>Most people who know me personally don't know this, but I have been separated
 from my wife on-and-off for the past few years. I posted to FB when it happened
 but that upset my wife, so I deleted the post. I was hoping to work things out,
 but that looks less and less likely. We're still best friends, and are probably
 better for each other separately than as a couple. We're co-parenting well, and
 all is fine, which is why I never told anyone else since that initial post. If 
 this is how you're finding out, I'm sorry for not telling you sooner. I just
 don't care to talk about it because I am fine and don't want it to be what
 people focus on when they're around me.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I posted about <a href="/on-the-passing-of-my-father.html">my father's passing on January 14</a>. Since then, I
 have heard absolutely nothing. I find it peculiar that I still cannot find his 
 obituary or notice of his funeral or anything else about it online. I expected 
 to at least see a post on Facebook by the half-sister who notified me, but I 
 have not even seen that. I find this rather... peculiar... </p>

On the passing of my father
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202501161006.58# -->

<p>On Tuesday, I got word from my half-sister that my father has passed away. I 
 believe he was 85 years old. This has led to some rather complex emotions over 
 the passed couple of days.</p>

<p>For a little background, my parents divorsed when I was young. I'm not sure 
 exactly how old I was because my childhood memories are extremely fuzzy, plus 
 my  perception of time seems scewed to begin with, but I would guess around 
 five years old. I say this because I have a vague recollection of starting 
 school in one school and my mom walking me to that school. Then I remember
 transferring to another school in kindergarden, and I remember the house we
 lived in when I went to the second one, and we lived there with my dad and
 step-mother (my dad's third wife, as I recall). So obviously my father got
 custody of my sisters (one younger, one older) and I.</p>

<p>When I was 8, we moved to Florida. After a year and a half or so, my older
 sister decided she wanted to go live with our mom and step-dad. Our father
 agreed to let her and my sister go live there, since he didn't want to
 separate the two. But at 9, he gave me the choice to stay with him or go with
 my sisters. For the longest time, I hated him for making me choose my sisters
 over him, but obviously did.</p>

<p>I only saw or spoke to him once after that, and it was when I was a teen and
 still bitter about it. I have long since let that hatred, anger, and bitterness
 go, and replaced them with... nothing...</p>

<p>For his part, I don't know much about what happened after my sisters and I
 left. I know he remarried his fourh wife, and he had three more children with
 her. Two more girls and a boy. That marraige lasted until her passing a year or two ago.</p>

<p>For my part, I realize that he was probably afraid that I'd have felt pushed
 away, so thought he was sparing me that by giving me a choice. I suspect he
 already knew the outcome, or didn't plan on separate us and would have talked
 me into going with me sisters.</p>

<p>Because I knew he was getting up there in age, and I'm in my 50s and becoming
 more and more aware of my own mortality, I'd recently started thinging about
 getting in touch, if just to let him know I didn't hold any annimosity. I've
 also thought about getting ahold of my half-siblings, whom I've never met, to
 see if they would help me know him through their eyes. I don't remember much
 about my father, and it is tainted by all those years of resentment.</p>

<p>His passing has triggered some very vague and fuzzy memories, though, and I 
 can only speculate on what I remember correctly, and what my mind is filling
 in.</p>

<p>For instance, I have a very fuzzy memory if it being nighttime, us being 
 outside at our grandparents' home, and flashing lights, someone holding a baby
 on the porch (either my mom or grandma holding my little sister, most likely),
 and my dad standing with his hands behind his back like a soldier standing at-
 ease. I seem to remember someone screaming at my father, probably my mother,
 and maybe police? The flashing lights were maybe from their cars? Maybe my dad
 was getting arrested for a domestic situation?</p>

<p>I also think maybe the divorce was a result of my mom cheating on him. It was
 the 70's, and courts usually favored the mother when it came to custody, of all
 my friends growing up who had divorced parents, very few of their fathers had
 even split custody. So the only way my father would have gotten custody is if
 my mother just okay, or if she had caused the end of the marraige.</p>

<p>This is just speculation, of course, but now there is no one who could verify
 any of it. My older sister passed away over nine years ago, and we never really
 talked about our father. My little sisted was just a baby, and had cut tied
 with the family regardless. I doubt my half-siblings would have heard much
 about his previous life.</p>

<p>My 10yo daughter is in Cross Country this year, and this is her finishing her first-ever race with a 10:27.42 mile. This is about 2 minutes faster than an average 10yo beginner, and just a few seconds faster than an average 10yo novice. This papa is so proud of his little girl.</p>
