<p>I've been playing around with TrueNAS, Home Assistant, and the like, and set up the above control panel
so that I can view the status of apps and various sensors in my home. There's so much more that can be
done, but this is a start. ;)</p>

<p>I may, at some point, move this site back to self-hosting, as I have managed
to get a reverse-proxy setup so that <a href="lg15.cassieiswatching.com">lg15.cassieiswatching.com</a>  works whichever
upstream ISP is working at the moment. This allows me to self-host even if
carrier-grade NAT is being used. I suggest watching the embedded video for a
quick how-to.</p>

<p>For the two people following here, you may have noticed that I've been 
 screaming into the void a bit more often that I was. I have been turning here
 instead of Facebook a bit more whenever I have something to say. It seems to
 help me stay off of FB a bit more. ;)</p>

<p>Some time ago, I purchaced a refurbished payphone online. I bought it
 unprogrammed, as I wasn't sure how I wanted to set it up, but had some issues
 getting it to keep some of my settings. I had plugged the internal battery in,
 and had followed all the instructions. Yet my changes to change collection
 never seemed to last. Well, recently I also discovered that the phone wasn't
 working at all. I opened the phone and removed the battery and tested it, and
 it was dead. So I thought I'd take the board out and see if I could bypass it
 coin collection completely, and I discovered a second battery on the back of
 the board. So I did a little more digging, and discovered the first battery
 apparently provided power to the relay, and the one I discovered powers the
 chip which saves the setting. I tested it, and the voltage measured a bit low
 as well. Replacement batteries ordered, so I should finally be able to set the
 phone the way I'd like it set.</p>

<p>In the process, I also discovered a blog post about <a href="https://philtel.org/2022/06/27/fixing-a-protel-pt1.html">fixing a Protel payphone</a>.
 It appears to be more-or-less the same phone as I have, and has a lot of
 interesting information that I hadn't run across before. Worth checking out if
 you're interested in such things at all.</p>

<p>Most people who know me personally don't know this, but I have been separated
 from my wife on-and-off for the past few years. I posted to FB when it happened
 but that upset my wife, so I deleted the post. I was hoping to work things out,
 but that looks less and less likely. We're still best friends, and are probably
 better for each other separately than as a couple. We're co-parenting well, and
 all is fine, which is why I never told anyone else since that initial post. If 
 this is how you're finding out, I'm sorry for not telling you sooner. I just
 don't care to talk about it because I am fine and don't want it to be what
 people focus on when they're around me.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I posted about <a href="https://www.nitemarecafe.com/on-the-passing-of-my-father.html">my father's passing on January 14</a>. Since then, I
 have heard absolutely nothing. I find it peculiar that I still cannot find his 
 obituary or notice of his funeral or anything else about it online. I expected 
 to at least see a post on Facebook by the half-sister who notified me, but I 
 have not even seen that. I find this rather... peculiar... </p>

<p>I just realized that I failed to update my <a href="https://www.nitemarecafe.com/feed.rss">rss feed</a> to use <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/wintermutesblog">Feedburner</a>, so have rectified that. The original one provided by the software still works, but I just realized that my blog's two followers probably stopped getting updates a long time ago. lol</p>

<p>Slightly longer review: I know. It's a movie meant for kids. My 10yo daughter 
loves the books. She and my 6yo daughter seemed to enjoy it, but I was sitting 
there feeling like I was in a 5-hour documentary on paperclips. Many kid's movies
have plenty of humor aimed at the adults in the audience, but if this movie had 
any of that I completely missed it. I think I laughed once as something that was 
slightly humorous. The "Bad Guys" short they showed before the movie was 
hilarious, though. ;)</p>
