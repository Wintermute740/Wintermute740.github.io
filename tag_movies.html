<p>Last night I managed to get two rewatches in to celebrate my upcoming vacation week.</p>

<p>I started off with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/">Hi Fidelity</a>. That
 one is a bit of a slow burn before it starts getting good. Does kinda make me with I could
 just open a record store though. ;)</p>

<p>And the second rewatch was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099575/">Fire Birds</a>,
 which is basically <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/">Top Gun</a> in Apache
 attack helicopters with quite possibly even more star power in the cast. It was quite a bit
 better than I remembered it being and I enjoyed it very much.</p>

<p>Confession time: I never saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119229/">
 Grosse Pointe Blank</a> when it first came out. I didn't see it until many years
 later. This rewatch was only the second time I've seen the movie. And what a quirky
 little movie it is. It's a romcom. It's a thriller. It's an action-adventure. It's a
 crime drama. It's a bit of all those things, but unlike many films which fail to be
 more than one or two things, this one works.</p>

<p>Somewhat ironically, had I watched it when it first made it to premium cable,
it probably would have been somewhere around the time of my own 10 year reunion.</p>

<p>Yet another movie rewatch? Well, it's what I've been doing a lot lately, so sure. Why not? ;)</p>

<p>This time, it was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097236/">Dream a Little Dream</a>. I remember
seeing this one a few times shortly after it came out, and while I enjoyed it I found it a bit on the weird
side. It wasn't the type of movie I particularly liked back then, but something drew me to it.</p>

<p>This is the first time I've rewatched it in nearly 40 years, and it hits a lot differently when you're
older instead of recently graduated from high school. I actually like it even more now that I can relate to
Coleman as much as I related to Bobby back when it came out.</p>

<p>If you didn't like it when you were young, watch it again with an open mind. You may find you like it now.</p>

<p>I promise the blog isn't becoming a movie blog, but I am starting to rewatch
 a bunch of ones from my youth through my 20s. ;) This time, the rewatch was for
 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/">Revenge of the Nerds</a>.</p>

<p>There are quite obviously some problematic scenes in the movie. Lewis tricking
 Betty by pretending to be her boyfriend was wrong. I know they needed the two to
 connect for the movie to completely work, but there had to be another way.</p>

<p>Lamar's homsexuality carried a message of inclusion, but at the same time was
 played as a joke. I suppose that was the only way it could have been played at
 that point in the 80s, but it doesn't make it right. The jokes surrounding it
 most definitely fall flat these days. Asshole 14 year-old me probably found it
 funny. Luckily, people can grow out of stuff like that.</p>

<p>The body-shaming of the women of Omega Mu played for comedy was another
 problem with the film. I get that 14 year olds weren't meant to be allowed to
 see the film, but my parents were pretty liberal in some parts of their lives.
 I saw through that, because 14 year-old me thought most of the girls who were
 meant to be shown as "ugly" were better looking than most of the cheerleaders.
 I've never been one to abide by society's concept of "beauty." ;)</p>

<p>There are lots of of other problematic issues which made the film not age
 very well at all. Those issues were also problems with society at large back
 then, and many of them are, unfortunately, still a problem. But some of us
 managed to grow since then.</p>

<p>Now, you might be thinking that I did not enjoy rewatching the movie. You'd
 be dead wrong. I was a nerd. I am a nerd. I've alway preferred "geek," thank-
 you-very-much, so I identified with Lewis and Gilbert and the rest. I still
 do. The underlying story is still good, and not all of the comedy relied on
 the problematic parts. I still enjoyed the film, because I was able to look
 past the problems and at the underlying message of acceptance and inclusion,
 which I think is the real message of the film.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, we lost another great actor in Val Kilmer. Most people will
 always think of Iceman from Top Gun when they think of him, or Batman, but to me
 he will always be Chris Knight from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/">
 Real Genius</a>. So to honor him in my own way, I continued my rewatch of my old
 favorites with this gem.</p>

<p>Even though laser technotogy has come a long way since the mid-80's, this movie
 played just as well today as it did 40 years ago. I'm guessing people not interested
 in such technology probably now about the same amount about lasers now as they did
 back then, and because the laser was just a prop for the character-driven story, the
 movie aged well.</p>

<p>If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to check it out. It's one of my
 favorite movies of all time, and some of Val Kilmer's best work.</p>

The Matrix: Ressurections

<p>Wrapped my rewatch with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10838180/">The 
 Matrix: Ressurections</a> last night, and I barely made it through it. I kept
 finding myself distracted and reaching for my phone to play a round of Suduku
 or something to keep me entertained.</p>

<p>It wasn't bad, per-se, but I think it brings the problems with all the sequels
 to the foreground. They all focused way too much on the love story between Neo
 and Trinity, and also went all-in on the action. While I liked the concept, which 
 went back to bending reality and  asking what was real and what wasn't, but instead
 of being subtle about it, it kept hitting us over the head with it. It wasn't
 taking us on a journey, it was preaching at us. And that was even worse than
 focusing on the wrong things. ;)</p>

<p>There is another sequel in the works. I hope they drop the love story. I hope
 they use action well, like in the first one, and don't rely on it too much like
 they did with all the sequels. I hope they find a good concept and take us on a
 journey instead of bludgeoning us with it. Time will tell.</p>

<p>We finally made it to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">Revolutions</a>,
 that unsatistfying end to the original Matrix trilogy. I no longer feel like
 <a href="the-matrix-reloaded.html">Reloaded</a> ruined it, and it's not a <b>bad</b>
 movie. It just wasn't great. I'm glad I finally rewatched it.</p>

<p>Overall, the entire trilogy holds up fairly well. The original was mind-blowing
 when it came out and is still a great film. The other two are simultaniously
 better and worse than I remembered them. The second one was too long and the ending
 just wasn't very satisfying, which is probably why they eventually made the new one,
 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10838180/">The Matrix: Cash Grab</a>, errr... 
 <b>Resurrections</b>. I'll be wrapping up with that next, even though it took me
 several attempts to make it through it the first time.</p>

<p>The rewatch continues with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The 
 Animatrix</a>. It's harder to judge this one, as it's the only animated one in the
 series, and is also a bunch of different shorts taking place at vaious different
 times in the chonology. This is why I am doing these in release order instead of
 chronologically.</p>

<p>Some of the shorts are prequels, some take place between the movies, and some
 have no specific timeframe and could take place at any time before, during, or
 after the original trilogy. They are considered canon, though, so I included them
 in the rewatch.</p>

<p>I  amd not a huge anime fan, but I remember enjoying these when they came out,
 and I still enjoyed them on this rewatch. The styles they're done in varies, and
 I quite enjoyed the different ways they were animated. The range from more traditional
 anime to near-realistic, almost uncanny valley, type of animation. And the stories
 really flesh out the universe a bit, which gives the entire series much more depth.</p>

<p>I decided to not skip anything in my rewatch of <a href="/the-matrix.html">The
 Matrix</a>, and am watching them in release order, so that meants I did wind up
 watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">Reloaded</a> last night.</p>

<p>I think this is the first time I've rewatched it since it came out. As previously
 mentioned, I had originally thought that the series was stronger without it, and
 that it someone ruined <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">Revolutions</a>.
 While still not my favorite movie, I didn't find it nearly as bad as I did way
 back when I originally watched it. There are a few scenes which probably should
 have never made it past the cutting room, but overall it was better than I remembered.</p>

<p>Because I am going in release order, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The
 Animatrix</a> is next.</p>

<p>Continuing on my binge of older movies, I just finished the first of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>
 trilogy, and I am suprised at how well it holds up.</p>

<p>I remember when this one first came out. My wife an I watched a *lot* of movies
 back then. We had gone to a packed cinema on a Friday or Saturday evening and took
 her brother and parents with us. The showing was nearly sold out, and we wound up
 with crappy seats (way too close and way too off from the center of the screen) for
 a movie none of us had actually heard of. And then the lights went down and the
 movie started, and all the complaining about being too crowded and crappy seats
 suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the original held up extremely well. I did not like the second
 film in the series, and always felt like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">
 Revolutions</a> would have been much better if Reloaded had never happened, so I don't know
 whether to skip <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">Reloaded</a> and go
 straight to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The Animatrix</a> or not.</p>

 and I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler, but <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109068/">Airheads</a>

<p>Many times, when I watch a movie that I haven't seen in a long time, it triggers
 a flood of memories. Not so with this one, but I enjoyed every minute of the extended
 cut of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080455/">The Blues Brothers</a>. This
 is such an amazing movie, even 45-ish years after I first saw it, that I didn't even
 notice that is was 2 1/2 hours.</p>

<p>John Belushi was such an amazing actor who left us way too soon, but this movie is
 filled with amazing talent, from the comedic actors to the amazing musicians who lend
 their talent to the movie. There are also a ton of great cameos. Some of them are
 pretty obvious, but some of them not so much. ;) I won't spoil them for you if you
 have never noticed some of the actors and musicians (and others) who show up in a
 scene here or there, but even many of the &quot;extras&quot; were, or later became,
 famous in their own right. ;)</p>

<p>If it's been awhile since you've seen it, or especially if you've never seen it
 before, you owe it to yourself to watch it as soon as you have the time.</p>

<p>Slightly longer review: I know. It's a movie meant for kids. My 10yo daughter 
loves the books. She and my 6yo daughter seemed to enjoy it, but I was sitting 
there feeling like I was in a 5-hour documentary on paperclips. Many kid's movies
have plenty of humor aimed at the adults in the audience, but if this movie had 
any of that I completely missed it. I think I laughed once as something that was 
slightly humorous. The "Bad Guys" short they showed before the movie was 
hilarious, though. ;)</p>
