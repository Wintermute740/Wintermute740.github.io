<p>At this point, I can't even remember where the title of this post comes from. All I know is that ever since I read that somewhere else, every iteration of this blog has had a post with that title. I had to keep the tradition alive. ;)</p>
<p>I am a fan of paranormal shows. UFOs, ghost hunting, etc. I've had some experience which, when I was younger, attributed to the paranormal. I still cannot explain those experiences, but I no longer attribute them to something paranormal. It's easy to miss some detail that would explain things perfectly and have your imagination fill in the rest, especially if it were primed to do so.</p>
<p>But this post isn't about my experiences. This is about a rabbit hole that I just got sucked into by my 10yo daughter. We had taken my girls to King's Island a week or so ago, and my wife had pointed out a restaurant which she thought was the one featured on <i>Ghost Hunters</i> because my 10yo loves watching reruns of the show. This morning, my 10yo wanted to watch that episode, which is S8E01, "Roller Ghoster." My daughter mentioned that she didn't think it was the same restaurant that my wife had mentioned, but thought maybe it had changed names. She was correct on the first count. My wife had pointed out the wrong restaurant.</p>

<p>During my research I discovered a <a href="https://browsingtheatlas.com/2012/10/05/the-ghosts-of-kings-island/">brief post</a> by an area local who remembered a story about a teen who fell to death climbing the Eifel Tower on May 13, 1983. Naturally, since the claim is that it happened on Friday the 13th, the first stop was to verify that the date was, indeed, a Friday. I was somewhat surprised that it was. "Okay," I thought. So, someone made something up because it was a Friday the 13th. But the post did include a name, and searching for "John Harter 1983 obituary" confirms the rest of the story (aside from the underage drinking, but being 1983 and a graduation celbration, that detail isn't much of a stretch). Though it's hard to say if there's more to the article behind a paywall, or of the blurb is all it got, it did make the <h ref=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/us/death-at-graduation-party.html">NY Times</a>. I would love to know what ghost stories surround this incident.</p>

<p>This also reminds me of a project I've been meaning to do for the <a href="/tag_ghosts-of-ohio.html">Ghosts of Ohio</a> section of the site. I need to catalog, review, and further research the <i>Ghost Hunters</i> episodes which take place in my home state. If anyone wants to contribute stories related to any of the <i>Ghost Hunters</i> episode locations, or <a href="/tag_ghosts-of-ohio.html">Ghosts of Ohio</a> in general, email me at wintermute AT nitematecafe DOT com.</p>
