<p>Wrapped my rewatch with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10838180/">The 
 Matrix: Ressurections</a> last night, and I barely made it through it. I kept
 finding myself distracted and reaching for my phone to play a round of Suduku
 or something to keep me entertained.</p>

<p>It wasn't bad, per-se, but I think it brings the problems with all the sequels
 to the foreground. They all focused way too much on the love story between Neo
 and Trinity, and also went all-in on the action. While I liked the concept, which 
 went back to bending reality and  asking what was real and what wasn't, but instead
 of being subtle about it, it kept hitting us over the head with it. It wasn't
 taking us on a journey, it was preaching at us. And that was even worse than
 focusing on the wrong things. ;)</p>

<p>There is another sequel in the works. I hope they drop the love story. I hope
 they use action well, like in the first one, and don't rely on it too much like
 they did with all the sequels. I hope they find a good concept and take us on a
 journey instead of bludgeoning us with it. Time will tell.</p>

<p>We finally made it to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">Revolutions</a>,
 that unsatistfying end to the original Matrix trilogy. I no longer feel like
 <a href="the-matrix-reloaded.html">Reloaded</a> ruined it, and it's not a <b>bad</b>
 movie. It just wasn't great. I'm glad I finally rewatched it.</p>

<p>Overall, the entire trilogy holds up fairly well. The original was mind-blowing
 when it came out and is still a great film. The other two are simultaniously
 better and worse than I remembered them. The second one was too long and the ending
 just wasn't very satisfying, which is probably why they eventually made the new one,
 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10838180/">The Matrix: Cash Grab</a>, errr... 
 <b>Resurrections</b>. I'll be wrapping up with that next, even though it took me
 several attempts to make it through it the first time.</p>

<p>The rewatch continues with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The 
 Animatrix</a>. It's harder to judge this one, as it's the only animated one in the
 series, and is also a bunch of different shorts taking place at vaious different
 times in the chonology. This is why I am doing these in release order instead of
 chronologically.</p>

<p>Some of the shorts are prequels, some take place between the movies, and some
 have no specific timeframe and could take place at any time before, during, or
 after the original trilogy. They are considered canon, though, so I included them
 in the rewatch.</p>

<p>I  amd not a huge anime fan, but I remember enjoying these when they came out,
 and I still enjoyed them on this rewatch. The styles they're done in varies, and
 I quite enjoyed the different ways they were animated. The range from more traditional
 anime to near-realistic, almost uncanny valley, type of animation. And the stories
 really flesh out the universe a bit, which gives the entire series much more depth.</p>

<p>I decided to not skip anything in my rewatch of <a href="/the-matrix.html">The
 Matrix</a>, and am watching them in release order, so that meants I did wind up
 watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">Reloaded</a> last night.</p>

<p>I think this is the first time I've rewatched it since it came out. As previously
 mentioned, I had originally thought that the series was stronger without it, and
 that it someone ruined <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">Revolutions</a>.
 While still not my favorite movie, I didn't find it nearly as bad as I did way
 back when I originally watched it. There are a few scenes which probably should
 have never made it past the cutting room, but overall it was better than I remembered.</p>

<p>Because I am going in release order, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The
 Animatrix</a> is next.</p>

<p>Continuing on my binge of older movies, I just finished the first of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>
 trilogy, and I am suprised at how well it holds up.</p>

<p>I remember when this one first came out. My wife an I watched a *lot* of movies
 back then. We had gone to a packed cinema on a Friday or Saturday evening and took
 her brother and parents with us. The showing was nearly sold out, and we wound up
 with crappy seats (way too close and way too off from the center of the screen) for
 a movie none of us had actually heard of. And then the lights went down and the
 movie started, and all the complaining about being too crowded and crappy seats
 suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the original held up extremely well. I did not like the second
 film in the series, and always felt like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">
 Revolutions</a> would have been much better if Reloaded had never happened, so I don't know
 whether to skip <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">Reloaded</a> and go
 straight to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The Animatrix</a> or not.</p>
