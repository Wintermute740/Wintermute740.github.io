<p>I posted this on FB, but I plan on giving that up soon, so I am repeating it here:</p>

<p>Someone in a CRT group (on FB), of all places, recently recommended the TV show <i>Severance</i>, a few weeks before season 2 started. So I binged it to be ready for season 2, and it is a wonderfully quirky show which you'll either love or hate. People go through a procedure to separate their work lives from the rest of their lives. Literally. While they're an "innie," they have no memory of the outside world. They have no knowledge of their "outie's" lives at all. To them, they're always at the office. And the opposite is true. Their "outie" has no knowledge of their "innie's" lives, and none of their memories. They go to work, and their next memory is of them leaving work. It's an interesting concept on it's own, but there's also a strange cult, and rituals. Definitely worth checking out.</p>

<p>On a related note, Apple TV+ is also adapting <i>Neuromancer</i> to TV, and has completed a couple of weeks of shooting in Tokyo so far. I'm <b>really</b> looking forward to that one!</p>

Rewatch: Northern Exposure

<p>I just finished a rewatch of <i>Northern Exposure</i> and I forgot how delightfully quirky it had gotten in spots. I also realize that when it was on first-run, I must have stopped watching somewhere during the 5th season.
</p>
<p>Overall, it holds up fairly well but definitely has a certain 90's charm. If this were my first watch, at my current age (instead of a younger adult), I'm not sure if that charm would have drawn me in if I weren't already a fan of the characters.</p>
<p>If you were a fan before, it's worth watching again. If you weren't, it's still worth catching a few episodes to see if the charm and the quirkiness draws you in. You'll chuckle a lot, and probably laugh a lot. You'll probably come away caring about the characters, because the show also makes you feel for them.</p>
