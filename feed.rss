The Matrix
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Continuing on my binge of older movies, I just finished the first of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>
 trilogy, and I am suprised at how well it holds up.</p>

<p>I remember when this one first came out. My wife an I watched a *lot* of movies
 back then. We had gone to a packed cinema on a Friday or Saturday evening and took
 her brother and parents with us. The showing was nearly sold out, and we wound up
 with crappy seats (way too close and way too off from the center of the screen) for
 a movie none of us had actually heard of. And then the lights went down and the
 movie started, and all the complaining about being too crowded and crappy seats
 suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the original held up extremely well. I did not like the second
 film in the series, and always felt like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">
 Revolutions</a> would have been much better if Reloaded had never happened, so I don't know
 whether to skip <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">Reloaded</a> and go
 straight to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/">The Animatrix</a> or not.</p>

Airheads
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>This one is a bit newer than <a href="/the-blues-brothers.html">The Blues Brothers</a>,
 and I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler, but <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109068/">Airheads</a>
 was another great music comedy that I just finished a rewatch of. Definitely going in my rotation for
 fairly regular rewatch.</p>

The Blues Brothers
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Many times, when I watch a movie that I haven't seen in a long time, it triggers
 a flood of memories. Not so with this one, but I enjoyed every minute of the extended
 cut of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080455/">The Blues Brothers</a>. This
 is such an amazing movie, even 45-ish years after I first saw it, that I didn't even
 notice that is was 2 1/2 hours.</p>

<p>John Belushi was such an amazing actor who left us way too soon, but this movie is
 filled with amazing talent, from the comedic actors to the amazing musicians who lend
 their talent to the movie. There are also a ton of great cameos. Some of them are
 pretty obvious, but some of them not so much. ;) I won't spoil them for you if you
 have never noticed some of the actors and musicians (and others) who show up in a
 scene here or there, but even many of the &quot;extras&quot; were, or later became,
 famous in their own right. ;)</p>

<p>If it's been awhile since you've seen it, or especially if you've never seen it
 before, you owe it to yourself to watch it as soon as you have the time.</p>

Some Links
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I've added a page to share some <a href="/links.html">links</a> for sites I enjoy, some of them small and some not. I started when a friend mentioned his wife's page about 
 <a href="https://ominouswoosh.neocities.org/">Twin Peaks</a>, and I will add sites as I go. Some of the links will be to people I know, or close to someone I know, and some
 will just be stuff I've stumbled across, probably via a <a href="http://webring.dinhe.net/random">Random</a> <a href="http://wiby.me/surprise/">button</a> for one of the
 <a href="http://geekring.net/site/NUMBER/random">Webrings</a> I've joined, <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">surfing the web the way it was meant to be surfed</a>.</p>

The Song Remains the Same
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p><img src="images/series10.jpg" width="25%" align="left"/>I wrote this on FB the other day,
 but thought I should share it here as well:<br />
 <br />
It's funny how I used to have a near-photographic memory, but now I barely remember my childhood,
 and even my teen years, at all, other than as vague shadows. But sometimes, something comes 
 alongs and opens the floodgates. Usually music. :) And I was just watching Led Zeppelin's 
 <i>The Song Remains the Same</i> for the first time since I was 16, and I was suddenly transported
 to a house on Clayton Drive in Lancaster. I was friends with two brothers, and their house was 
 practically a second home for the lot of us who hung out together. We watched that movie so many 
 times... That, and <i>Headbanger's Ball</i> on MTV, and a bunch of of AC/DC concerts on VHS. Brian 
 was the first of us to own a guitar... A Bently Series 10, if I remember correctly... I'm 99% 
 certain one identical to the one on this post... And I "sang" while he played. Of course, being 
 metal, and having to project my voice over his amp, it was more screaming than singing, but still...
 lol... Even when the rest of our friends were off doing other things, I was either working out with 
 Greg or jamming with Brian.<br />
<br />
They were from Cincinnati, and a bit after I moved to Georgia in high school, they moved away from 
 Lancaster. I believe back to Cincinnati. But after that, I lost contact with those two. Two of the 
 other guys in the band I jammed with up until the pandemic were part of that group of friends, and
 they had lost contact as well. The entire group of us were great friends, but Brian was my best 
 friend for a couple of years, up until I moved. I've tried to find the two of them online, but I 
 honestly doubt either ever developed much of an online presence...

Not retro enough...
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Since beginning to drive this site with <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog/tree/master">bashblog</a>,
 I have allowed a minor bit of bloat to creep back in. I do drive the site with a bit of css,
 but I have tried to keep the design fairly simply despite this so that the site renders
 perfectly fine using any low-powered (and even text-only) web browser.</p>

<p>A couple of features require the user to allow JavaScript. For a connection to <a href="/chat.html">Discord</a>,
 this is fine. It's a completely optional part of the site, and not in active use, so if you
 don't have JavaScript, no biggie. You're not really missing anything. But even though they
 are rarely used, I absolutely <b>have</b> to allow comments. Unless I go back to self-hosting
 (which is actually feasible again via <a href="/cloudflare.html">Cloudflare</a>),
 the only way to allow them was to connect to <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, which
 also requires JavaScript. This is not ideal, and I may be able to hack together a small bit
 of php to enable comments if I go back to self-hosting, but because comments rarely get used,
 I am not sure it is worth the effort of seeing them as more than an optional part of the site.</p>

<p>Also, there's the <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/wintermutesblog">Feedburner</a> version
 of <a href="/feed.rss">my feed</a>, which is again optional, and
 only enabled for the person or two who were using it to follow me. lol. The second link takes
 you to the actual feed. ;)</p>

<p>So, if you're able to comment (if not, feel free to email me at wintermute @ my domain),
 what do you think? Should I forgo the nicities and strip away the optional bloat? Should
 I leave it as-is, because it doesn't impede anyone's ability to follow the site?</p>

<p>As an aside, this post was partly inspired by one about <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">rediscovering the small web</a>.
 I strongly suggest you go read that.</a>

VoIP.ms
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Well, it finally happened. I got and installed replacement batteries for my <a href="/payphone.html">payphone</a>,
 but it still did not work completely. My OBI200 ATA finally quit working with Google Voice, as it has been end-of-support for some time
 now. I knew it was coming, but hadn't made a backup plan. So I found an inexpensive VoIP provider, <a href="http://voip.ms">VoIP.ms</a>,
 and managed to get it going fairly quickly. There are walkthroughs for configuring a ton of different devices, so a quick factory-reset
 of the OBI and following a quick guide, and all is good. It was something like $0.85 for the DID, and around $0.009/minute for calls. I
 think they offer "unlimited" plans as well. They also have a basic Cisco IOS configuration for their service, so I think I may have a
 provider to use with my dial-up ISP project.</p>

The Arrow and the Song
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p><cite>The Arrow and the Song</cite><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>
<p>
I shot an arrow into the air,<br />
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br />
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight<br />
Could not follow it in its flight.<br />
<br />
I breathed a song into the air,<br />
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br />
For who has sight so keen and strong,<br />
That it can follow the flight of song?<br />
<br />
Long, long afterward, in an oak<br />
I found the arrow, still unbroke;<br />
And the song, from beginning to end,<br />
I found again in the heart of a friend.</p>

Home Automation
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p><img src="images/Homarr.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I've been playing around with TrueNAS, Home Assistant, and the like, and set up the above control panel
so that I can view the status of apps and various sensors in my home. There's so much more that can be
done, but this is a start. ;)</p>

Cloudflare
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I may, at some point, move this site back to self-hosting, as I have managed
to get a reverse-proxy setup so that <a href="http://lg15.cassieiswatching.com">lg15.cassieiswatching.com</a>  works whichever
upstream ISP is working at the moment. This allows me to self-host even if
carrier-grade NAT is being used. I suggest watching the embedded video for a
quick how-to.</p>
