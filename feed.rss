Screaming into the void
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>For the two people following here, you may have noticed that I've been 
 screaming into the void a bit more often that I was. I have been turning here
 instead of Facebook a bit more whenever I have something to say. It seems to
 help me stay off of FB a bit more. ;)</p>

Payphone
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Some time ago, I purchaced a refurbished payphone online. I bought it
 unprogrammed, as I wasn't sure how I wanted to set it up, but had some issues
 getting it to keep some of my settings. I had plugged the internal battery in,
 and had followed all the instructions. Yet my changes to change collection
 never seemed to last. Well, recently I also discovered that the phone wasn't
 working at all. I opened the phone and removed the battery and tested it, and
 it was dead. So I thought I'd take the board out and see if I could bypass it
 coin collection completely, and I discovered a second battery on the back of
 the board. So I did a little more digging, and discovered the first battery
 apparently provided power to the relay, and the one I discovered powers the
 chip which saves the setting. I tested it, and the voltage measured a bit low
 as well. Replacement batteries ordered, so I should finally be able to set the
 phone the way I'd like it set.</p>

<p>In the process, I also discovered a blog post about <a href="https://philtel.org/2022/06/27/fixing-a-protel-pt1.html">fixing a Protel payphone</a>.
 It appears to be more-or-less the same phone as I have, and has a lot of
 interesting information that I hadn't run across before. Worth checking out if
 you're interested in such things at all.</p>

Gotta Keep It Separated
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Most people who know me personally don't know this, but I have been separated
 from my wife on-and-off for the past few years. I posted to FB when it happened
 but that upset my wife, so I deleted the post. I was hoping to work things out,
 but that looks less and less likely. We're still best friends, and are probably
 better for each other separately than as a couple. We're co-parenting well, and
 all is fine, which is why I never told anyone else since that initial post. If 
 this is how you're finding out, I'm sorry for not telling you sooner. I just
 don't care to talk about it because I am fine and don't want it to be what
 people focus on when they're around me.</p>

No further news of my father's passing
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>A few weeks ago, I posted about <a href="https://www.nitemarecafe.com/on-the-passing-of-my-father.html">my father's passing on January 14</a>. Since then, I
 have heard absolutely nothing. I find it peculiar that I still cannot find his 
 obituary or notice of his funeral or anything else about it online. I expected 
 to at least see a post on Facebook by the half-sister who notified me, but I 
 have not even seen that. I find this rather... peculiar... </p>

Feedburner

<p>I just realized that I failed to update my <a href="https://www.nitemarecafe.com/feed.rss">rss feed</a> to use <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/wintermutesblog">Feedburner</a>, so have rectified that. The original one provided by the software still works, but I just realized that my blog's two followers probably stopped getting updates a long time ago. lol</p>

One-word review: Dog Man
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Dud</p>

<p>Slightly longer review: I know. It's a movie meant for kids. My 10yo daughter 
loves the books. She and my 6yo daughter seemed to enjoy it, but I was sitting 
there feeling like I was in a 5-hour documentary on paperclips. Many kid's movies
have plenty of humor aimed at the adults in the audience, but if this movie had 
any of that I completely missed it. I think I laughed once as something that was 
slightly humorous. The "Bad Guys" short they showed before the movie was 
hilarious, though. ;)</p>

Network redesign
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I'm starting to redesign my home newtwork. I started by getting a new router which allows
muliple WANs, with automatic failover from one to the other, because my primary ISP frequently
has short outages during my workday. Since them, I've also upgraded my server from an old
gaming PC to an actual NAS, running the same services I was on the server but via docker
containers. I still have a couple services to move over, but that is mostly done. I also
plan to upgrade my WiFi and such. I went with TPlink, as they are low-cost but offer the same
functionality as many of the enterprise solutions out there. The router is already TP-Link,
and I just purchased the controller. Next payday, I'll probably pick up a couple of APs and
probably a POE switch.</p>

Severance
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I posted this on FB, but I plan on giving that up soon, so I am repeating it here:</p>

<p>Someone in a CRT group (on FB), of all places, recently recommended the TV show <i>Severance</i>, a few weeks before season 2 started. So I binged it to be ready for season 2, and it is a wonderfully quirky show which you'll either love or hate. People go through a procedure to separate their work lives from the rest of their lives. Literally. While they're an "innie," they have no memory of the outside world. They have no knowledge of their "outie's" lives at all. To them, they're always at the office. And the opposite is true. Their "outie" has no knowledge of their "innie's" lives, and none of their memories. They go to work, and their next memory is of them leaving work. It's an interesting concept on it's own, but there's also a strange cult, and rituals. Definitely worth checking out.</p>

<p>On a related note, Apple TV+ is also adapting <i>Neuromancer</i> to TV, and has completed a couple of weeks of shooting in Tokyo so far. I'm <b>really</b> looking forward to that one!</p>

Navbar
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I decided to add a navbar, because it may help someone find something they're looking for at some point, and rather than expend the braincells to do the minimal work to create the CSS from scratch, I just Googled it. And the colors used were perfect as-is. lol</p>

On the passing of my father
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>On Tuesday, I got word from my half-sister that my father has passed away. I 
 believe he was 85 years old. This has led to some rather complex emotions over 
 the passed couple of days.</p>

<p>For a little background, my parents divorsed when I was young. I'm not sure 
 exactly how old I was because my childhood memories are extremely fuzzy, plus 
 my  perception of time seems scewed to begin with, but I would guess around 
 five years old. I say this because I have a vague recollection of starting 
 school in one school and my mom walking me to that school. Then I remember
 transferring to another school in kindergarden, and I remember the house we
 lived in when I went to the second one, and we lived there with my dad and
 step-mother (my dad's third wife, as I recall). So obviously my father got
 custody of my sisters (one younger, one older) and I.</p>

<p>When I was 8, we moved to Florida. After a year and a half or so, my older
 sister decided she wanted to go live with our mom and step-dad. Our father
 agreed to let her and my sister go live there, since he didn't want to
 separate the two. But at 9, he gave me the choice to stay with him or go with
 my sisters. For the longest time, I hated him for making me choose my sisters
 over him, but obviously did.</p>

<p>I only saw or spoke to him once after that, and it was when I was a teen and
 still bitter about it. I have long since let that hatred, anger, and bitterness
 go, and replaced them with... nothing...</p>

<p>For his part, I don't know much about what happened after my sisters and I
 left. I know he remarried his fourh wife, and he had three more children with
 her. Two more girls and a boy. That marraige lasted until her passing a year or two ago.</p>

<p>For my part, I realize that he was probably afraid that I'd have felt pushed
 away, so thought he was sparing me that by giving me a choice. I suspect he
 already knew the outcome, or didn't plan on separate us and would have talked
 me into going with me sisters.</p>

<p>Because I knew he was getting up there in age, and I'm in my 50s and becoming
 more and more aware of my own mortality, I'd recently started thinging about
 getting in touch, if just to let him know I didn't hold any annimosity. I've
 also thought about getting ahold of my half-siblings, whom I've never met, to
 see if they would help me know him through their eyes. I don't remember much
 about my father, and it is tainted by all those years of resentment.</p>

<p>His passing has triggered some very vague and fuzzy memories, though, and I 
 can only speculate on what I remember correctly, and what my mind is filling
 in.</p>

<p>For instance, I have a very fuzzy memory if it being nighttime, us being 
 outside at our grandparents' home, and flashing lights, someone holding a baby
 on the porch (either my mom or grandma holding my little sister, most likely),
 and my dad standing with his hands behind his back like a soldier standing at-
 ease. I seem to remember someone screaming at my father, probably my mother,
 and maybe police? The flashing lights were maybe from their cars? Maybe my dad
 was getting arrested for a domestic situation?</p>

<p>I also think maybe the divorce was a result of my mom cheating on him. It was
 the 70's, and courts usually favored the mother when it came to custody, of all
 my friends growing up who had divorced parents, very few of their fathers had
 even split custody. So the only way my father would have gotten custody is if
 my mother just okay, or if she had caused the end of the marraige.</p>

<p>This is just speculation, of course, but now there is no one who could verify
 any of it. My older sister passed away over nine years ago, and we never really
 talked about our father. My little sisted was just a baby, and had cut tied
 with the family regardless. I doubt my half-siblings would have heard much
 about his previous life.</p>
