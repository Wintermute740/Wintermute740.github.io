<p>Since beginning to drive this site with <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog/tree/master">bashblog</a>,
 I have allowed a minor bit of bloat to creep back in. I do drive the site with a bit of css,
 but I have tried to keep the design fairly simply despite this so that the site renders
 perfectly fine using any low-powered (and even text-only) web browser.</p>

<p>A couple of features require the user to allow JavaScript. For a connection to <a href="/chat.html">Discord</a>,
 this is fine. It's a completely optional part of the site, and not in active use, so if you
 don't have JavaScript, no biggie. You're not really missing anything. But even though they
 are rarely used, I absolutely <b>have</b> to allow comments. Unless I go back to self-hosting
 (which is actually feasible again via <a href="/cloudflare.html">Cloudflare</a>),
 the only way to allow them was to connect to <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, which
 also requires JavaScript. This is not ideal, and I may be able to hack together a small bit
 of php to enable comments if I go back to self-hosting, but because comments rarely get used,
 I am not sure it is worth the effort of seeing them as more than an optional part of the site.</p>

<p>Also, there's the <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/wintermutesblog">Feedburner</a> version
 of <a href="/feed.rss">my feed</a>, which is again optional, and
 only enabled for the person or two who were using it to follow me. lol. The second link takes
 you to the actual feed. ;)</p>

<p>So, if you're able to comment (if not, feel free to email me at wintermute @ my domain),
 what do you think? Should I forgo the nicities and strip away the optional bloat? Should
 I leave it as-is, because it doesn't impede anyone's ability to follow the site?</p>

<p>As an aside, this post was partly inspired by one about <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">rediscovering the small web</a>.
 I strongly suggest you go read that.</a>

<p>Some time ago, I purchaced a refurbished payphone online. I bought it
 unprogrammed, as I wasn't sure how I wanted to set it up, but had some issues
 getting it to keep some of my settings. I had plugged the internal battery in,
 and had followed all the instructions. Yet my changes to change collection
 never seemed to last. Well, recently I also discovered that the phone wasn't
 working at all. I opened the phone and removed the battery and tested it, and
 it was dead. So I thought I'd take the board out and see if I could bypass it
 coin collection completely, and I discovered a second battery on the back of
 the board. So I did a little more digging, and discovered the first battery
 apparently provided power to the relay, and the one I discovered powers the
 chip which saves the setting. I tested it, and the voltage measured a bit low
 as well. Replacement batteries ordered, so I should finally be able to set the
 phone the way I'd like it set.</p>

<p>In the process, I also discovered a blog post about <a href="https://philtel.org/2022/06/27/fixing-a-protel-pt1.html">fixing a Protel payphone</a>.
 It appears to be more-or-less the same phone as I have, and has a lot of
 interesting information that I hadn't run across before. Worth checking out if
 you're interested in such things at all.</p>
